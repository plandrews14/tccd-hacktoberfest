It's really hard for me to study for hours at a time.  Instead, I use what's called the Pomodoro technique.  This technique uses intervals for studying and for taking breaks.  I'll set the timer for a long study session of 25 minutes.  It's long for me!  Then at the end, I get to reward myself with a short break of 5 minutes.  I'll set the timer to make sure I don't spend too long on my break.  Then next is a short study session of 15 minutes.  I follow it with a long break of 15 minutes.  This means that out of an hour of studying, I'll spend 40 minutes focused on my work, and 20 minutes away.  Sometimes I use the breaks to do small errands or chores. Either way, I'm able to stay focused because I can tell myself that when I feel jittery or want to stop, that I'll be able to stop soon, I just need to study a little bit longer until the buzzer goes off.

### Online Timers
If you want to try this out, you can find interval timers online.  Here are a couple I've used in the past.
